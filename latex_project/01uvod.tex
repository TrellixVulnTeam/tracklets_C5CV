	While we are able to put vehicles, both manned and unmanned, into space, in majority of cases it is not cost efficient to return them back to Earth. In some cases, such as from unpredictable events, mistakes in calculations or even from the effects of the Sun, orbiting satellites collide or break up. Therefore, the term space debris encompasses all artificial non-functional objects orbiting around Earth.

	As is mentioned in this document, there are almost no space debris creation mitigation processes in place and those which are, are too insignificant to make a visible difference. This results in the rapidly increasing number of space debris. Even though the major agencies, for example European Space Agency (ESA) or National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), already have plans for major space debris clean-ups in motion it is still vitally important to track, catalogue and observe existing debris, as it threatens missions - both future and present - and functioning satellites.

	In this thesis we analyse and provide another solution to the problem of assigning observations of the same object in time together - tracklet building.
