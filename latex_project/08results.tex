\section{TDM and MPC formats, CCSDS}\label{sec:tdm_ccsds}

	This section provides insight over standardised output data formats used in this work and encouraged by multinational agencies. 

\subsection{CCSDS}\label{subsec:ccsds}
	The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) is a multi-national forum formed by major space agencies to provide platform for discussion of common problems in the development, operation and maintenance of space data systems and is currently composed of 11 member agencies, 28 observer agencies and over 140 industrial associates \citep{ccsds}.

\subsection{TDM format}

		Tracking Data Message (TDM) is a standard message format for exchange of spacecraft tracking data between space agencies recommended by the CCSDS.
